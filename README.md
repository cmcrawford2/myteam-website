## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements throughout the site
- See the correct content for each team member on the About page when the `+` icon is clicked
- Receive an error message when the contact form is submitted if:
  - The `Name`, `Email Address` or `Message` fields are empty should show "This field is required"
  - The `Email Address` is not formatted correctly should show "Please use a valid email address"

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to customize form validation messages with javascript, including _not_ validating the email form as it was being typed.

### Continued development

I was not able to figure out a way to disable to submit button when the form wasn't completely filled out.

### Useful resources

I started reading MDN docs about forms, but in the end I just asked ChatGPT for help. It was a bit of a struggle, but we worked it out.
